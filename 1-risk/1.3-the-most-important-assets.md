# 1.3.1 - Bonds

- We already discussed the simplest asset: riskless gov't bonds

- A gov't bond typically lasts 30 years, and is made up of two parts:
    - 1 - The coupon
        - These are like the interest payments received by the bond holder
    - 2 - The principal
        - This is the amount returned to the bond holder after the 30 years are up

- So, if I lent my friend $100 dollars for 30 years at a 10% annual interest rate, then I'd receive $10 each year for 29 years, and at the end of the 30th year I'd receive $110 ($100 for the original loan amount, and $10 of interest)
    - For a bond, the $10 interest payments are the coupons, and the $100 to return the original loan amount is the principal

**Zero coupon bonds**

- What if we have a bond where the coupon payments are $0?
    - We won't be happy just getting our $100 dollars of principal back
        - So, instead of paying the full principal amount upfront, we discount it from the date of maturity back to today

- These are called Zero Coupon Bonds

- **Example**
    - Imagine we buy a zero coupon bond that will pay us $110 dollars in one year
        - **How much should we pay for the bond?**
            - Well, if there are other one-year bonds available that pay 10% interest, we need to receive at least a 10% return on this zero coupon bond for it to be worth our while
                - **Therefore, we should pay $100 for this bond, and when we get the $110 at the end of the year, it's the same as if we had bought a bond with $100 principal and a $10 coupon**


**Is there no risk at all for a gov't bond?**

- We can consider the default risk to be essentially zero for some gov't bonds, but *is that the only risk?*
    - **NO**

- **Consider this:**
    - If we buy a bond with principal $100 and an annual coupon of $10, is this a good deal?
        - **It depends**
            - If I can get a 15% return in some other, equally riskless investment, **it is a bad deal**
            - If I can't, it's a good deal

- So, the idea is, while the coupon is locked in and so is the final repayment of principal, we need to consider the opportunity cost of having our money tied up while there may be other more profitable investments (with the same level of risk)
    - This is where interest rates come in

- If interest rates go up while we're holding a bond, the relative value of the coupon payments we're expecting to receive go down
    - **Why?**
        - If we're receiving $10 coupons, we're getting a 10% return on our investment
            - If interest rates were 7% when we bought the bond, this was a good deal
                - But if they jump to 11%, then all of a sudden our 10% return is less than what we would get if we sold the bond and invested it at 11% into something else
                    - This change is reflected in the price of the bond

- There's a well-established market for gov't bonds, so an investor doesn't need to hold them to maturity
    - The market price for a gov't bond will reflect the current level of interest rates, as well as any future expectations for interest rates
        - E.g. if the market expects interest rates to go down in 6 months, would that increase or decrease the market price of a bond?
            - INCREASE
                - This is because the relative value of the coupons will go up

- **Consider this:**
    - Now that we know that changes in interest rates have an impact on the market price of a bond, which would we expect to be more affected by a change in interest rates: a 30 year bond issued 29 years ago, or a 30 year bond issued 1 year ago?
        - The newer bond (i.e. the one issued a year ago) will be more affected
            - **Why?**
                - We have very few coupon payments remaining for the old bond
                    - A low proportion of its present value is made up of the coupons
                        - Therefore, there's less uncertainty about the "value" of what we'll receive
                - The younger bond has lots of uncertainty about where interest rates will be over its lifetime

**Yield Curve**

- If we take the market price of a bond, and compare it to the coupons and pricipal amount (taking into account the time to maturity), we can calculate the **yield** of the bond
    - This basically means: what is the effective return for buying the bond at today's market price?
        - **Note**: the coupon of the bond can be different from the yield of the bond

- Recall how bonds with longer time to maturity have more uncertainty about changes in interest rates
    - What would this mean for yields? Would investors expect to be compensated for taking this additional risk?
        - YES
            - Yields for longer bonds are typically higher
                - **Note**: market prices (and hence yields) aren't just linear estimates for interest rate riskiness
                    - They also incorporate supply, demand, etc.
                        - Therefore yield curves can take many different shapes
