**What is the concept of market efficiency?**

- It's the idea that in a free market, the market price of an asset already includes all information
    - The true value of any asset is its price since everything is already baked in
    
**Is this accurate?**

- Sort of
    - Consider this story: two economists are walking down the sidewalk when one notices a \$10 bill in the gutter
        - When he reaches down to pick it up, the other economist tells his not to be so silly - if it were in fact a real \$10 bill, someone would have picked it up already
        - The moral of the story is that for an efficient market to actually work, you need to have **some people that don't believe in market efficiency**, and they're the ones that grab the \$10 bill
        
- However, keep in mind that Warren Buffett's wealth was built on not believing market consensus
    - He made his money by beating the market

- For us, though, there are so many people trying to become the next Warren Buffett that we can assume the market is efficient

**So what does the market price of an asset tell us about its riskiness?**

- The riskiness is baked into the price
    - **Example**: How much should you pay to play the following game: on a coin flip, you win \$3 if the coin turns up heads, but lose \$1 if it's tails
        - You have a 50% chance of winning \$3, and a 50% chance of losing \$1, so the expected payoff is (0.5)(\$3) - (0.5)(\$1) = \$1
            - **So, if you pay anything less than \$1 to play, you can expect to make money by playing the game**
            
- Consider the same example, but the amounts are \$103 and \$101
    - You still expect to win $1, but you risk losing \$101 instead of just \$1
        - **So you're risking losing way more money to get the same expected payoff**
        
**Another example**

- This time, instead of flipping the coin and settling the bet, you pay the dealer \$101 today, and he flips the coin 1 year from now
    - If the coin comes up heads, he refunds you the \$101, and also pays you the $103
        - If it's tails, he just keeps the \$101 you already gave him
    - **Why is this game worse?**
        - Because he can take the \$101, deposit into a bank, and earn interest on it
            - He's getting paid to hold your money for a year
                - **Therefore, you won't be happy winning the \$1 expected payoff**
                    - **You'll demand the \$1, PLUS INTEREST**
                    
**So, since we believe in market efficiency (for the most part), what is the point of mathematical finance?**

- Since the market price is driven by new information flowing in, and we don't know whether the next bit of info to come in will be positive or negative, **we can think of it as being random**
    - So it's our job to control for this randomness by **hedging**
