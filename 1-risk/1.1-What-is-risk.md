- Risk is the key concept of modern finance
    - Every transaction is essentially buying (increasing) or selling (decreasing) risk
    
- **What is a riskless asset?**
    - An asset where we know 100% what its final value will be
    - *Do such assets exist?*
        - Kinda
        - The classic example is a government bond
            - We can pretty much assume that we'll get our money back
            
- *But what if the government does default?*
    - Then the whole system will probably collapse anyways
    
- **So now that we know what a riskless asset is, what is a risky asset?**
    - Any asset that isn't riskless!
        - The classic example is a share of some public company
            - But since gov't bonds are pretty much the only riskless assets, **every other asset is risky**
            
- Recall: \$1 today is worth more than \$1 tomorrow, so a riskless return is the rate on the gov't bond
    - Simply maintaining the nominal value is **losing value** (due to inflation, opportunity cost)
    
- Interesting example: you can buy a UK gov't bond that has no coupons, but instead the holder gets entered into a prize draw
    - This is essentially the same as buying a regular bond and using the coupons to purchase lottery tickets
        - **The investor is using coupons from a riskless investment to buy small amounts of risk**
